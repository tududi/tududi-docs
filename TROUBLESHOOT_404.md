# Troubleshooting 404 Error

## Current Status

✅ **DNS is working**: docs.tududi.com → tududi.github.io
❌ **No gh-pages branch exists yet** - This is the problem!
❌ **No content deployed** - GitHub Pages has nothing to serve

## The Issue

GitHub Pages needs content to serve, but there's nothing deployed yet. The gh-pages branch (where GitHub Pages looks for content) doesn't exist.

## Solution: Check GitHub Actions Status First

### Step 1: Check if workflow ran
Go to: **https://github.com/tududi/tududi-docs/actions**

Look for the latest workflow run. What do you see?

#### If GREEN ✅ (Success):
The build worked, but deployment might have failed. Check:
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Is Source set to **"GitHub Actions"**?
3. Do you see a deployment listed?

#### If RED ❌ (Failed):
Click on it to see the error. Common issues:
- Permissions not set correctly
- Node version issue (should be fixed now)

#### If YELLOW ● (Running):
Wait for it to complete (1-2 minutes)

#### If NOTHING (No workflows):
The workflow hasn't triggered. Try:
```bash
# Make a small change to trigger it
echo "# Trigger deploy" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin master
```

## Critical: GitHub Pages Settings

Go to: **https://github.com/tududi/tududi-docs/settings/pages**

### If using GitHub Actions (Recommended):
1. **Source**: Must be **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
2. **Custom domain**: Enter `docs.tududi.com`
3. Click Save
4. Wait for DNS check to complete
5. Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

### If no "GitHub Actions" option appears:
You need to enable it:
1. Settings → Pages
2. Under "Build and deployment"
3. Source dropdown should show "GitHub Actions"
4. If not visible, your repo might need to be public

## Alternative: Manual Deploy

If GitHub Actions isn't working, deploy manually:

```bash
cd /Users/chris/c0deLab/ProjectLand/tududi-docs

# Build locally
npm run build

# Deploy to gh-pages branch
npx gh-pages -d build -m "Manual deployment"

# This will create the gh-pages branch and push content
```

Then in GitHub Settings → Pages:
1. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
2. Branch: **gh-pages** / **/(root)**
3. Custom domain: `docs.tududi.com`
4. Save

## Verify Deployment

After deploying, check:

```bash
# See if gh-pages branch exists
git ls-remote origin gh-pages

# Should show something like:
# abc123... refs/heads/gh-pages
```

If you see the branch, wait 2-3 minutes then try:
- https://docs.tududi.com
- https://tududi.github.io/tududi-docs/ (if baseUrl was wrong)

## Quick Fix Summary

**Fastest solution:**

```bash
# 1. Install gh-pages if needed
npm install -g gh-pages

# 2. Build and deploy manually
npm run build
npx gh-pages -d build -m "Initial deployment"

# 3. Configure GitHub Pages
# Go to Settings → Pages
# Source: Deploy from a branch
# Branch: gh-pages / /(root)
# Custom domain: docs.tududi.com
# Save
```

Wait 3-5 minutes, then visit https://docs.tududi.com

## Still Not Working?

### Check 1: Is the repo public?
Private repos need GitHub Pro for GitHub Pages

### Check 2: Check GitHub Pages build status
Settings → Pages should show:
- "Your site is live at https://docs.tududi.com"
- Or "Your site is ready to be published"

### Check 3: Try the GitHub subdirectory URL first
Try: https://tududi.github.io/tududi-docs/

If this works but custom domain doesn't:
1. Check custom domain is set in GitHub Settings → Pages
2. Wait up to 10 minutes for DNS propagation
3. Clear browser cache
