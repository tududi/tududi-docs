# Quick Capture

Quick Capture is tududi's powerful system for capturing tasks, ideas, and notes with minimal friction. Using simple syntax with `#` tags and `+` projects, combined with intelligent AI suggestions, you can organize thoughts faster than ever.

## Overview

Quick Capture allows you to:
- üìù **Capture fast** - Type naturally and let tududi organize
- üè∑Ô∏è **Tag instantly** - Use `#` to categorize on the fly
- üìÅ **Assign projects** - Use `+` to file items immediately
- ü§ñ **AI assistance** - Intelligent suggestions based on your text
- ‚ö° **Auto-convert** - Tasks and notes created automatically

**Where Quick Capture Works:**
- Inbox (manual capture)
- Telegram messages (automatic inbox creation)
- Task creation modal
- Note creation modal

---

## Basic Syntax

### Tags with `#`

Use the hashtag symbol to add tags to your captures.

**Format:**
```
#tagname
```

**Rules:**
- Tags can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens
- No spaces allowed (use underscores or hyphens instead)
- Multiple tags must be consecutive to be recognized
- Tags are case-sensitive

**Examples:**
```
Buy groceries #shopping #home
‚Üí Tags: shopping, home
‚Üí Content: "Buy groceries"

Call dentist #urgent #health_care
‚Üí Tags: urgent, health_care
‚Üí Content: "Call dentist"

#work #meeting Prepare presentation
‚Üí Tags: work, meeting
‚Üí Content: "Prepare presentation"
```

**Important:** Tags must be grouped together:
```
‚úÖ WORKS: #work #urgent Complete report
‚úÖ WORKS: Complete report #work #urgent

‚ùå DOESN'T WORK: #work Complete #urgent report
   (Second tag won't be recognized)
```

---

### Projects with `+`

Use the plus symbol to assign captures to projects.

**Format:**
```
+projectname
+"Project Name with Spaces"
```

**Rules:**
- Project names without spaces: `+projectname`
- Project names with spaces: Use quotes `+"Project Name"`
- Multiple projects can be specified, but only the first is used
- Projects must be consecutive with tags to be recognized

**Examples:**
```
Fix bug in login +development
‚Üí Project: development
‚Üí Content: "Fix bug in login"

Schedule meeting +"Team Project" #work
‚Üí Project: Team Project
‚Üí Tags: work
‚Üí Content: "Schedule meeting"

#urgent +work Review pull requests
‚Üí Project: work
‚Üí Tags: urgent
‚Üí Content: "Review pull requests"
```

**Auto-Creation:**
If you reference a project that doesn't exist, tududi automatically creates it for you. No need to pre-create projects!

---

### Combined Syntax

Tags and projects work together seamlessly.

**Format:**
```
#tag1 #tag2 +project Your capture text here
```

**Examples:**
```
#shopping #urgent +home Buy milk before store closes
‚Üí Tags: shopping, urgent
‚Üí Project: home
‚Üí Content: "Buy milk before store closes"

+"Work Presentation" #slides #deadline Finish Q4 report
‚Üí Project: Work Presentation
‚Üí Tags: slides, deadline
‚Üí Content: "Finish Q4 report"

Review budget #finance #monthly +"Personal Finance"
‚Üí Tags: finance, monthly
‚Üí Project: Personal Finance
‚Üí Content: "Review budget"
```

---

## Intelligent Suggestions

tududi uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze your captures and suggest the best action.

### How It Works

When you type a capture, tududi analyzes:
1. **Action verbs** - Does it start with a verb like "buy", "call", "fix"?
2. **URLs** - Does it contain a web link?
3. **Context** - Tags and project references

Based on this analysis, tududi suggests:
- **Create as Task** - Action-oriented captures
- **Create as Note** - Reference material or bookmarks
- **Save to Inbox** - Items needing more thought

### Task Detection

**What Makes a Task:**
tududi looks for action verbs at the start of your capture:
- Buy, Call, Send, Write, Create, Fix, Update, Schedule, etc.

**Examples:**
```
Buy groceries #shopping
‚Üí Suggestion: CREATE AS TASK
‚Üí Reason: Starts with action verb "Buy"

Call dentist tomorrow #health
‚Üí Suggestion: CREATE AS TASK
‚Üí Reason: Starts with action verb "Call"

Fix the broken link in footer +website
‚Üí Suggestion: CREATE AS TASK
‚Üí Reason: Starts with action verb "Fix"
```

**What's NOT a Task:**
```
Thinking about redesigning the website
‚Üí Suggestion: SAVE TO INBOX
‚Üí Reason: Starts with "Thinking" (not an action verb)

The meeting notes from yesterday
‚Üí Suggestion: SAVE TO INBOX
‚Üí Reason: Starts with "The" (not a verb)
```

### Note Detection

**What Makes a Note:**
tududi suggests creating a note when:
- Your capture contains a URL
- You use the `#bookmark` tag

**Examples:**
```
https://example.com/article #research
‚Üí Suggestion: CREATE AS NOTE
‚Üí Reason: Contains URL
‚Üí Auto-tagged: #bookmark

Check out this tool https://tool.com
‚Üí Suggestion: CREATE AS NOTE
‚Üí Reason: Contains URL

Great article about productivity #bookmark
‚Üí Suggestion: CREATE AS NOTE
‚Üí Reason: #bookmark tag present
```

### Action Verbs Reference

tududi recognizes these action verbs (and many more):

**Common Actions:**
- Buy, Call, Send, Email, Write, Read
- Create, Make, Build, Design, Develop
- Fix, Update, Change, Modify, Edit
- Schedule, Plan, Organize, Arrange
- Check, Review, Verify, Confirm
- Research, Learn, Study, Practice

**Excluded (Not Actions):**
- Be, Have, Do, Will, Can, Should (auxiliary verbs)
- Think, Wonder, Consider (thoughts, not actions)

## Advanced Techniques

### Templated Captures

Create mental templates for recurring capture types:

**Morning Planning:**
```
#planning +daily Review priorities and schedule
#planning +daily Check email and respond to urgent items
#planning +daily Prepare for 9am meeting
```

**Meeting Capture:**
```
#meeting +work +"Q1 Planning" Discuss budget allocation
#meeting #action-items +work Follow up with Sarah on timeline
```

**Idea Capture:**
```
#idea +future App feature: Dark mode toggle
#idea #research Look into GraphQL for API
```

### URL Bookmarking

Quickly save articles and resources:

```
https://example.com/productivity-tips #productivity #bookmark
‚Üí Creates note with link
‚Üí Auto-tagged with #bookmark
‚Üí Easily searchable later

Great tutorial https://tutorial.com #learning +"Study Resources"
‚Üí Note in "Study Resources" project
‚Üí Tagged for easy retrieval
```

### Context-Based Tagging

Use tags to add context to tasks:

**Location:**
```
#home #office #phone #computer #errands
```

**Energy Level:**
```
#quick-win #deep-work #low-energy #high-focus
```

**Time Blocks:**
```
#morning #afternoon #evening #weekend
```

**Priority:**
```
#urgent #important #someday #waiting
```

**Example:**
```
#quick-win #phone Call pharmacy +health
‚Üí Quick task, can do by phone
‚Üí Easy to filter for 5-minute phone tasks
```

### Batch Processing

Capture multiple items quickly, process later:

**Capture Phase (Fast):**
```
Buy eggs #shopping
Call mom #personal
Fix header bug +website #urgent
Review contract #work
https://article.com #read-later
```

**Process Phase (Thoughtful):**
- Open inbox
- Review suggestions
- Convert each to task/note
- Assign due dates if needed
- Adjust priorities

## Best Practices

### Do's

‚úÖ **Capture immediately** - Don't overthink, just capture
‚úÖ **Use consistent tags** - Stick to a core set of tags
‚úÖ **Start with verbs** - "Buy groceries" not "Groceries to buy"
‚úÖ **Group tags together** - All tags at start or end
‚úÖ **Trust suggestions** - tududi's AI is usually right
‚úÖ **Process regularly** - Don't let inbox pile up

### Don'ts

‚ùå **Don't perfect while capturing** - Capture fast, refine later
‚ùå **Don't create too many tags** - More tags = harder to find things
‚ùå **Don't split tags** - `#work text #urgent` won't parse second tag
‚ùå **Don't use spaces in tags** - Use `#quick_win` not `#quick win`
‚ùå **Don't ignore suggestions** - They're based on NLP analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Tags Not Being Recognized

**Problem:** Tags aren't being parsed

**Solutions:**
- Ensure no spaces in tag names (use `#quick_win` not `#quick win`)
- Group all tags together (don't split with text)
- Check for special characters (only letters, numbers, `_`, `-` allowed)

**Example:**
```
‚ùå Buy #urgent milk #shopping
   ‚Üí Only #urgent recognized

‚úÖ #urgent #shopping Buy milk
   ‚Üí Both tags recognized
```

### Projects Not Auto-Creating

**Problem:** Project referenced but not created

**Solutions:**
- Use quotes for projects with spaces: `+"Project Name"`
- Ensure project name is valid (letters, numbers, spaces, `_`, `-`)
- Check that you have permission to create projects

### Suggestions Not Appearing

**Problem:** No intelligent suggestions shown

**Solutions:**
- Wait a moment (300ms delay before analysis)
- Ensure you have internet connection (if using external NLP)
- Try starting with a clear action verb
- Check that text is not empty

### Wrong Suggestion Type

**Problem:** Task suggested when you want a note (or vice versa)

**Solutions:**
- Manually select the correct type (override suggestion)
- Add `#bookmark` to force note creation for URLs
- Rephrase to start with action verb for tasks
- Suggestions are just suggestions - you always have control

## Tips for Power Users

### 1. Create Tag Shortcuts

Develop muscle memory for common tag combinations:

```
#w = #work
#wm = #work #meeting
#wu = #work #urgent
#qw = #quick-win
```

### 2. Project Naming Convention

Use consistent project naming:
- `+work-client-projectname` for work
- `+home-category` for personal
- `+learn-topic` for learning

### 3. Templated Daily Captures

Create recurring captures for daily routines:

```
#planning +daily Morning review
#planning +daily Evening review
#health +daily Log meals
#health +daily Exercise
```

### 4. Batch Similar Captures

Capture related items in sequence:

```
#shopping +home Buy milk
#shopping +home Buy eggs
#shopping +home Buy bread
```

Process all at once, create shopping list project.

### 5. Use Inbox as Thought Dump

Don't overthink during capture:
- Brain dump everything to inbox
- Use minimal tagging during capture
- Process and refine during dedicated inbox review
- Trust the suggestions during processing

## Caveats & Limitations

### Tag Parsing

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caveat:** Tags must be consecutive to be recognized

```
‚ùå #work Complete the #urgent report
   ‚Üí Only #work is recognized

‚úÖ #work #urgent Complete the report
   ‚Üí Both tags recognized
```

**Why:** This allows natural mixing of tags with text while maintaining parsing simplicity.

### Project References

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caveat:** Only the first project reference is used

```
#work +project1 +project2 Do the thing
‚Üí Only assigned to: project1
‚Üí project2 is ignored
```

**Why:** Tasks can only belong to one project in tududi.

### Quoted Project Names

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caveat:** Spaces require quotes

```
‚ùå +Work Project Do something
   ‚Üí Project: "Work" (space breaks parsing)

‚úÖ +"Work Project" Do something
   ‚Üí Project: "Work Project"
```

**Workaround:** Use underscores or hyphens: `+Work_Project`

### NLP Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caveat:** Verb detection isn't perfect

```
"Being productive today"
‚Üí Might not suggest task (starts with "Being", not clear action)

"Plan the meeting"
‚Üí Correctly suggests task (starts with "Plan", action verb)
```

**Workaround:** You can always manually choose task/note type, suggestions are just helpers.
