# Telegram Integration

tududi's Telegram integration allows you to capture tasks, ideas, and notes directly from Telegram messages. This creates a powerful quick-capture system that works wherever you are.

## Overview

The Telegram integration works by connecting a Telegram bot to your tududi instance. Any message you send to your bot automatically creates an item in your tududi inbox, ready to be processed into tasks, projects, or notes.

**Key Features:**
- **Quick Capture** - Send messages from anywhere, process them later
- **Automatic Inbox Creation** - Every message becomes an inbox item
- **Daily Task Summaries** - Optional notifications with your daily tasks
- **Privacy First** - All data stays on your self-hosted instance
- **No Third Parties** - Direct connection between Telegram and your tududi server

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Telegram integration, ensure:

- ‚úÖ tududi is installed and running
- ‚úÖ You have a Telegram account
- ‚úÖ Your tududi server can reach the internet (to access Telegram's API)
- ‚úÖ You're logged into tududi with admin privileges

---

## Creating Your Telegram Bot

### Step 1: Start a Chat with BotFather

1. Open Telegram
2. Search for **@BotFather** (official Telegram bot for creating bots)
3. Start a chat by clicking **Start** or sending `/start`

### Step 2: Create a New Bot

1. Send the command: `/newbot`
2. BotFather will ask for a **name** for your bot
   - Example: "My tududi Bot" or "John's Task Bot"
   - This is the display name users will see
3. BotFather will ask for a **username** for your bot
   - Must end with "bot" (e.g., `mytududi_bot`, `johntasks_bot`)
   - Must be unique across all Telegram
   - Cannot contain spaces or special characters except underscores

### Step 3: Save Your Bot Token

BotFather will respond with a success message containing your bot token:

```
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/mytududi_bot

Use this token to access the HTTP API:
123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxyz

Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.
```

**Important:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Copy and save this token immediately**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep it secret** - anyone with this token can control your bot
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't share it publicly or commit it to version control
- üí° You can always retrieve it later with `/mybots` ‚Üí select your bot ‚Üí API Token

## Configuring Telegram in tududi

### Step 1: Access Telegram Settings

1. Log into your tududi instance
2. Click your **user menu** (top right corner)
3. Select **Settings**
4. Navigate to the **Telegram** tab

### Step 2: Enter Your Bot Token

1. In the Telegram settings page, find the **Bot Token** field
2. Paste your bot token from BotFather (e.g., `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxyz`)
3. Click **"Setup Telegram"** or **"Save"**

### Step 3: Verify Connection

After saving, tududi will:
- ‚úÖ Validate your bot token with Telegram's API
- ‚úÖ Display your bot's username
- ‚úÖ Show connection status (Connected/Disconnected)
- ‚úÖ Provide a direct link to start chatting with your bot

If the connection is successful, you'll see:
- Bot username (e.g., `@mytududi_bot`)
- Status: **Connected** (usually shown in green)
- A link or button to open your bot in Telegram

---

## Starting to Use Your Bot

### Step 1: Start a Conversation

**Option A: Use the Link from tududi**
- Click the link provided in tududi's Telegram settings
- This opens your bot in Telegram
- Click **Start** to begin the conversation

**Option B: Search in Telegram**
- Open Telegram
- Search for your bot's username (e.g., `@mytududi_bot`)
- Click on your bot
- Click **Start**

### Step 2: Send Your First Message

Simply type any message and send it to your bot:

```
Buy groceries tomorrow
```

### Step 3: Check Your tududi Inbox

1. Return to tududi
2. Click **Inbox** in the sidebar
3. You should see your message as a new inbox item!

**If you don't see it immediately:**
- Wait 30 seconds (polling interval)
- Refresh the page
- Check the Telegram settings for polling status

---

## How It Works

### Message Polling

tududi uses **polling** to check for new messages:

1. **Every 30 seconds**, tududi asks Telegram: "Any new messages?"
2. If yes, Telegram sends the new messages
3. tududi creates inbox items for each message
4. Messages are marked as processed to prevent duplicates

**Technical Details:**
- Polling runs automatically when bot token is configured
- Polling can be paused/resumed from Telegram settings
- Only messages sent after bot setup are captured
- Historical messages are not imported

### Inbox Item Creation

When you send a message to your bot:

```
Message: "Buy groceries tomorrow"
         ‚Üì
Telegram Bot API receives message
         ‚Üì
tududi polls and retrieves message
         ‚Üì
Creates Inbox Item:
  - Content: "Buy groceries tomorrow"
  - Source: Telegram
  - Status: "added"
  - Timestamp: When message was sent
```

### Duplicate Prevention

tududi prevents the same message from creating multiple inbox items by:
- Tracking Telegram message IDs
- Only processing new messages since last poll
- Maintaining update offset to skip old messages

---

## Processing Inbox Items

Messages from Telegram land in your **Inbox** awaiting processing.

### Inbox Workflow

1. **Review** - Open the Inbox and review captured items
2. **Process** - For each item, decide its fate:
   - **Convert to Task** - Create a task with this content
   - **Convert to Project** - This needs multiple steps
   - **Convert to Note** - Reference material or idea
   - **Delete** - Not needed

### Convert to Task

1. Open the inbox item
2. Click **"Convert to Task"** or similar action
3. Task is created with:
   - Name: The message content
   - Due date: Can be set during conversion
   - Project: Can be assigned during conversion
   - Priority: Can be set during conversion
4. Inbox item is marked as processed or deleted

**Pro Tip:** Use natural language in messages:
- "Buy groceries tomorrow" ‚Üí Sets content, you add due date during processing
- "Call dentist urgent" ‚Üí Sets content, you mark as high priority
- "Project idea: Home automation" ‚Üí Convert to project

### Convert to Project

For larger ideas that need multiple tasks:

1. Select inbox item
2. Click **"Convert to Project"**
3. Project is created with message as name/description
4. Add tasks to the project afterward

### Convert to Note

For reference material, ideas, or documentation:

1. Select inbox item
2. Click **"Convert to Note"**
3. Note is created with message content
4. Optionally tag or assign to project

---

## Daily Task Summaries

Enable daily notifications to receive a summary of your tasks via Telegram.

### Enabling Summaries

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Telegram**
2. Find **"Daily Task Summaries"** or **"Task Notifications"**
3. Toggle **Enable**
4. Optionally set:
   - **Summary Time** - When to receive (e.g., 8:00 AM)
   - **Include Completed** - Show completed tasks or not
   - **Summary Type** - Today only, Today + Upcoming, etc.

### What's Included

Daily summaries typically include:
- **Tasks due today**
- **Overdue tasks**
- **Optionally:** Upcoming tasks for next few days
- **Task counts** by status or project

**Example Summary:**
```
üìù Good morning! Here's your day:

Today (3):

‚Ä¢ Submit expense report
