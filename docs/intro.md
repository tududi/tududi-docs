# Introduction 

## What is tududi?

tududi is a self-hosted, open-source task management and life organization system designed to give you complete control over your productivity data. Built with privacy as a core principle, tududi provides a powerful alternative to cloud-based task management tools while offering the flexibility to organize your work and life exactly the way you want.

Unlike rigid productivity systems that force you into their workflows, tududi adapts to how you think and work. Whether you're managing personal projects, coordinating with a team, or organizing every aspect of your life, tududi provides the structure and tools you need without getting in your way.

## Why tududi?

### Privacy First
Your tasks, projects, and notes stay on your server. No third-party access, no data mining, no surprise policy changes. You own your data, period.

### Flexible Organization
Organize tasks into projects, group projects into areas, and tag everything for easy filtering. Create custom views that match exactly how you want to see your work.

### Built for Collaboration
Share projects with teammates using granular permission controls. Give read-only access for stakeholders or full edit access for collaborators.

### Capture Ideas Anywhere
Integrate with Telegram to capture tasks on the go. Ideas come to you anywhere - your task manager should too.

### Truly Self-Hosted
Run tududi on your own infrastructure with a single Docker command. No monthly fees, no user limits, no feature paywalls.
