## Setting Up Recurring Tasks

Automate repetitive tasks with sophisticated recurring patterns.

### Create a Recurring Task

   - **Monthly on Weekday** - E.g., "First Monday" or "Last Friday"
5. Set options:
   - **Interval** - Every 1 week, every 2 weeks, etc.
   - **Based on** - Completion date or due date
   - **End date** - Optional end to the recurrence
6. Save

### How Recurring Tasks Work

- **Automatic Generation** - New task instances are created based on your pattern
- **Parent-Child Linking** - Generated tasks link back to the original
- **Edit Recurrence** - Change recurrence settings from any instance
- **Complete One, Next Appears** - Completing a task generates the next occurrence

**Example**: "Weekly team meeting" set to recur every Monday
- Complete Monday's task â†’ Next Monday's task is automatically created
- Due date-based: Task always created for upcoming Monday
- Completion-based: Task created 7 days after completion

## Creating Notes

Notes capture documentation, ideas, and reference material.

### Standalone Notes

5. Optionally attach to a project

### Project Notes

Notes attached to projects serve as documentation:

3. Click **"+ Add Note"**
4. Create note (automatically associated with project)

**Use Cases:**
- Project requirements and specifications

## Managing Your Inbox

The inbox is your capture system for quick ideas, especially from Telegram.

### Processing Inbox Items

1. Click **"Inbox"** in sidebar
2. Review each item
3. For each item, decide:
   - **Convert to Task** - Create a task with this content
   - **Convert to Project** - This needs multiple steps
   - **Convert to Note** - This is reference material
   - **Delete** - Not needed anymore

**Inbox Zero Workflow:**
1. Process inbox daily
2. Don't leave items sitting for more than 24 hours
3. Make quick decisions: task, project, note, or delete
4. Keep inbox empty for mental clarity

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up your workflow with keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + N` | New task |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + K` | Quick search |

## Completing and Archiving Tasks

### Mark a Task Complete

**Quick Method:**

3. Task moves to archive

### Viewing Completed Tasks

## Tips for Success

### Start Small
Don't migrate your entire task list on day one. Start with:
1. Today's tasks
2. One active project
3. Your most urgent items

Build your system gradually as you learn the interface.

### Use Areas Wisely
Don't create too many areas. Start with 3-5 major life domains:
- Work
- Personal
- Health

Add more only when genuinely needed.

### Tag Sparingly
Tags are powerful but can become overwhelming. Start with a few essential tags:
- Context tags (`@home`, `@office`)
- Energy tags (`#quick-win`, `#deep-work`)

Add more tags only when you find yourself repeatedly filtering for something.

### Review Weekly
Set up a weekly review routine:
1. Process inbox to zero
2. Review upcoming tasks
3. Update project statuses
4. Archive completed items

This keeps your system clean and trustworthy.

### Recurring Tasks for Routines
Use recurring tasks for:
- Weekly planning sessions
- Monthly reviews
- Regular errands (grocery shopping, etc.)
- Routine maintenance tasks

Automate the routine to focus on the important.

- Check the due date is today or earlier
- Refresh the page
