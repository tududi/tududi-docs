# Feature Requests

Have an idea to improve tududi? We'd love to hear it!

## Before Requesting

1. **Search** [existing requests](https://github.com/chrisvel/tududi/issues?q=label%3Aenhancement)
2. **Check** the [roadmap](https://github.com/users/chrisvel/projects/2)
3. **Verify** feature doesn't already exist in [docs](/)

## Request on GitHub

Go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chrisvel/tududi/issues) ‚Üí **New Issue**

## What to Include

### Title
Clear and specific: "Add kanban board view for projects"

### Description
```markdown
## Problem
I need to visualize task workflow stages. List view doesn't show
the flow from "To Do" ‚Üí "In Progress" ‚Üí "Done" clearly.

## Proposed solution
Add kanban board view with:
- Customizable columns per project
- Drag-and-drop between columns
- Toggle between list/board view

## Use case
As a developer, I want to see which tasks are in code review vs
testing vs done, so I can identify bottlenecks quickly.

## Alternatives considered
- Using status tags (but no visual board)
- External tool like Trello (breaks self-hosting)
```

## Tips

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Explain the "why" (problem) before "what" (solution)
- Provide real use cases
- Consider alternatives

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Combine multiple unrelated features
- Expect immediate implementation
- Request features that break privacy/self-hosting principles

## What Happens Next

1. **Review** - Maintainers assess feasibility
2. **Discussion** - Community provides feedback
3. **Roadmap** - Popular requests get added to roadmap
4. **Implementation** - By maintainers or community
