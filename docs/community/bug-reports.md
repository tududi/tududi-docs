3. Select **"Bug Report"** template (if available)
4. Fill in all required information

### Bug Report Template

A good bug report should include:

#### 1. **Title**
Clear, concise description of the issue.

**Good examples:**
- "Recurring tasks not creating next instance after completion"
- "Telegram notifications fail to send with special characters"

- "Bug in tasks"
- "Error"

#### 2. **Description**
Detailed explanation of what's wrong.

```markdown
## Description
When I complete a recurring task that recurs every Monday,
the next instance is not automatically created. The task
just marks as complete and disappears from my task list.
```

#### 3. **Steps to Reproduce**
Exact steps to reproduce the bug. Be specific!

```markdown
## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a new task: "Weekly team meeting"
2. Set recurrence to "Weekly on Monday"
3. Set recurrence type to "Completion-based"
4. Mark the task as complete on Monday
5. Refresh the page
6. Check the task list for next Monday

**Expected:** New task instance appears for next Monday
**Actual:** No new task is created, original task is just completed
```

#### 4. **Expected Behavior**
What should happen?

```markdown
## Expected Behavior
After completing the recurring task, a new instance should
automatically be created for the next Monday with the same
title, description, and recurrence settings.
```

#### 5. **Actual Behavior**
What actually happens?

```markdown
## Actual Behavior
The task is marked as complete and no new instance is created.
The task disappears from "Today" and "Upcoming" views.
```

## Example Bug Reports

### Example 1: Good Bug Report

```markdown
# Title: Project sharing permissions not persisting after page refresh

## Description
When I share a project with read-only access and refresh the page,
the shared user gains read-write access instead.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a new project "Test Project"
2. Click Share button
3. Add user "user@example.com" with "Read only" permission
4. Click "Share"
5. Refresh the page (F5)
6. Check sharing settings again

## Expected Behavior
User should maintain read-only access after page refresh.

## Actual Behavior
User permission changes to read-write after refresh.

## Environment
- tududi Version: v0.85-beta.1
- Deployment: Docker
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Browser: Chrome 120.0.6099.109
- Database: SQLite

## Screenshots
[Screenshot 1: Before refresh showing read-only]
[Screenshot 2: After refresh showing read-write]

## Console Logs
```
GET /api/projects/123/shares 200 OK
Response: { "shares": [{ "email": "user@example.com", "permission": 2 }] }
// permission: 2 should be 1 for read-only
```

## Additional Context
- Happens with all projects
- Persists even after clearing browser cache
- Works correctly if I don't refresh
```

### Example 2: Security-Related Bug

```markdown
# Title: [SECURITY] Telegram bot token visible in client-side JavaScript

## Description
‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY ISSUE ‚ö†Ô∏è

The Telegram bot token is exposed in client-side JavaScript bundle,
allowing anyone to inspect the page source and extract it.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure Telegram integration
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Sources
3. Search for "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
4. Token is visible in minified JS

## Impact
- Anyone can extract and use the bot token
- Unauthorized users could send messages via the bot
- Bot could be compromised

## Suggested Fix
Move token to backend environment variables only.

## Environment
- tududi Version: v0.84
- Browser: Any
- Deployment: Docker

## Additional Context
This is a critical security vulnerability. Please handle privately.
I have emailed info@tududi.com with full details.
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "It doesn't work"
**Problem:** Too vague
**Solution:** Be specific about what doesn't work and what you expected

### Issue: Missing environment details
**Problem:** We can't reproduce without knowing your setup
**Solution:** Always include tududi version, deployment method, OS, and browser

### Issue: No steps to reproduce
**Problem:** We can't fix what we can't reproduce
**Solution:** Provide exact, numbered steps

### Issue: Screenshot of text instead of copy-paste
**Problem:** We can't search or copy error messages
**Solution:** Copy and paste text errors, use screenshots for visual issues only
